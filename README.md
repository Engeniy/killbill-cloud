Utilities to configure and launch Kill Bill
===========================================

There are two options to install Kill Bill:

* [KPM](https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/tree/master/kpm)
* [Docker](https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/tree/master/docker) (recommended)

KPM
---

KPM is the Kill Bill Package Manager. It is a low-level tool to setup Kill Bill, its plugins and Kaui.

Use it only if you cannot run Docker.

Docker
------

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the recommended way to run Kill Bill, both for developers and in production.

* For each Kill Bill and Kaui version, Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/killbill/)
* We also provider [Docker Compose recipes](https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/tree/master/docker/compose)

If you are not familiar with Docker, take a look at the [Get Started with Docker](http://docs.docker.com/mac/started/) guide.
